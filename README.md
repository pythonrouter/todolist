Project 01 : Simple To-Do List Manager

Project Description: The "Simple To-Do List Manager" is a Python-based application that allows users to manage their daily tasks and keep track of their to-do list. The application provides a user-friendly command-line interface, enabling users to add, remove, and view tasks easily. The project's main goal is to provide a straightforward and efficient way for users to organize their tasks and improve productivity.

Features:

Add Tasks: Users can add tasks to their to-do list by entering task descriptions through the command-line interface. Each task will be recorded with a timestamp, indicating when it was added.

Remove Tasks: If a task is completed or no longer relevant, users can remove it from the to-do list using the command-line interface. The application will handle the task's deletion and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

View Tasks: Users can view their entire to-do list at any time by selecting the corresponding option in the command-line menu. The list will display tasks along with their timestamps, making it easy to keep track of the tasks' order.

Task Persistence: The application will utilize file handling techniques to persist the to-do list between sessions. This ensures that the user's tasks remain saved even if they close the application or restart their computer.

Error Handling: The application will implement robust error handling to prevent crashes and provide user-friendly error messages if any unexpected situations arise.

Technical Details:

The project will be implemented in Python, leveraging its simplicity and ease of use for a command-line application.
The main data structure for the to-do list will be a Python list, allowing for easy addition and removal of tasks.
File handling will be employed to read and write the to-do list to a local file, ensuring task persistence.
The project will be modular, with separate classes or functions for adding, removing, and displaying tasks, as well as for user input handling.
The command-line interface will be designed to display a menu of options and receive user input accordingly.
User Interaction: Upon running the application, users will be presented with a simple command-line menu, where they can select from the following options:

Add Task: Allows users to input a new task description to be added to the to-do list.
Remove Task: Asks the user to input the task they want to remove and confirms the deletion.
View Tasks: Displays the entire to-do list along with timestamps.
Exit: Exits the application and saves the to-do list to a file for future use.
Potential Enhancements: To enhance the project further, additional features could be implemented, such as:

Task priorities and due dates.
Categorization of tasks (e.g., work, personal, shopping).
Option to mark tasks as completed or in progress.
Integration with a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
Conclusion: The "Simple To-Do List Manager" is an efficient and user-friendly Python application that allows users to maintain and organize their to-do lists effortlessly. By providing a straightforward command-line interface, the project enables users to focus on their tasks and stay on top of their daily responsibilities. With potential enhancements, the application can be expanded to cater to more complex task management needs and contribute to improved productivity and time management for users.
